                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>My name is Romain Savioz, a 25-year-old residing in Sion, Valais. Currently, I am in my final year at the Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne. The Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne, often abbreviated as EHL, stands as a beacon of excellence in hospitality education worldwide. Renowned for its rigorous academic programs, state-of-the-art facilities, and immersive learning experiences, EHL has been shaping future leaders in the hospitality industry for over a century.</p>

                    <p>Prior to my enrollment at EHL, I pursued studies at a business school where I obtained my CFC (Certificat Fédéral de Capacité) and commercial maturity. These foundational educational experiences laid the groundwork for my journey into the realm of hospitality.</p>

                    <p>Throughout my academic tenure, I've had the privilege of undertaking various internships, ranging from tourist offices to hotels and even a private clinic, alongside a stint at a prestigious horology company. These practical experiences served as invaluable opportunities to bridge the gap between theory and application, enriching my understanding of the intricacies of the hospitality industry.</p>

                    <p>Looking ahead, my aspirations post-graduation involve venturing abroad for a year or two to further hone my skills within the realm of hospitality. However, my ultimate goal is to return to Switzerland and delve into the captivating world of horology. Timepieces have always held a special place in my heart, and a recent internship in the field solidified my passion and determination to pursue a career in this industry.</p>

                     <p>In essence, my journey embodies a fusion of academic excellence, practical experience, and unwavering passion, all converging to shape a future dedicated to excellence in hospitality and horology.</p>

                    <p>Football has been a passion of mine since I was  five years old, when I first started playing for FC Bramois, a small village near Sion. Over the years, my love for this sport has only continued to grow. I began my journey in football by joining the youth academy and progressed through the ranks, playing in junior leagues before eventually reaching the regional 3rd division.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my football career, I've had the privilege of winning numerous titles, including four league championships and one Valais Cup. These victories stand as testament to the hard work, dedication, and teamwork that have defined my journey in football. Each triumph has not only brought personal satisfaction but also reinforced my passion for the game and motivated me to strive for excellence on and off the field.</p>

                <div class="description">
                <p>Since the age of 10, I've been captivated by the world of magic. It all began when I stumbled upon my first magic tutorial on YouTube. Mesmerized by the illusions, I eagerly purchased my first deck of cards and dedicated myself to mastering the art of magic. As I honed my skills, I invested in instructional DVDs, specialized accessories, and even enrolled in magic classes to refine my craft.</p>
                <p>My passion for magic centers around close-up card tricks, where I've found my niche. Over time, I've been fortunate enough to showcase my talents on stage, starting with my debut performance at a school talent show. This initial exposure fueled my ambition, leading to more opportunities to perform in various shows and events. I've also had the pleasure of entertaining guests at corporate dinners and children's birthday parties, adding a touch of wonder and excitement to every occasion.</p>
                <p>Throughout my journey, I've drawn inspiration from renowned magicians such as Dai Vernon, Jean-Pierre Vallarino, Eric Antoine, and the mentalist Viktor Vincent. Their creativity and mastery of the craft have served as guiding lights, pushing me to continually innovate and refine my repertoire. As I continue to explore the boundless possibilities of magic, I am driven by a passion to amaze, inspire, and delight audiences with the art of illusion.</p>
